        .heading Clinkle Careers
        .content A webapp through which applicants can apply to Clinkle. Backend is in Rails, the webapp is in Backbone.js, and jobs data is cached using localStorage. Building this taught me a lot about tuning JS/CSS animation performance with Chrome DevTools and the importance of loose coupling between views.

        .heading Clinkle Homepage
        .content Built and launched new home marketing page, new investor page, new team page, the CDN-backed blog, and the top 3/4ths of the Careers page in a 10-day sprint in response to the Apple Pay announcement, as people mistakenly thought Clinkle was competitor instead of a complementary product.

        .heading Support Page
        .content A VOIP call center, support team dashboard, and engineering tools suite. Backend in Rails, webapp in Backbone.js, and some views in React.js. Architecture is based around the Event Aggregator pattern and as a result many changes and feature requests were trivial to implement.

        .heading Hinge+
        .content Client spoof of the Hinge app with extra features. Reverse engineered Hinge's undocumented API with a self-inflicted Man-In-The-Middle attack using Charles Proxy. Implemented in Ember.js and Rails.

        .content Splice together segments of YouTube videos into an educational playlist of content. Of the four-man team that built this in a week, I was responsible for backend and performance. Optimized one search query from 30s to 100ms with action and fragment caching using memcached, counter caching, eager loading, SELECT DISTINCT, database indices, and keypress throttling.
